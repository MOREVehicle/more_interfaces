# MORE Interfaces

This ROS2 package declares the can message type used in [more_can](https://github.com/MOREVehicle/more_can)
 and [more_vehicle_interface](https://github.com/MOREVehicle/more_vehicle_interface)

If you plan to use the more_can node to send or receive CAN frames from the MORE vehicle you must add this package as a dependency.
